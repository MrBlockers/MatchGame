# Matching Game
This is a quick matching game written in Javascript. It runs on Node and uses
Bootstrap / Angular primarily for the front end, while node and express (among
jquery, underscore, etc) run the backend.

# How to execute
Open a shell at the root directory and run server.js with node ("node server").
The server listens on 8080, so you can point your browser there.
